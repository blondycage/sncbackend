        <h2>Finding Accommodation</h2>
        
        <h3>Rental Market</h3>
        <p>The rental market offers good value with options ranging from modern apartments to traditional village houses. Popular areas include Kyrenia, Famagusta, and the villages of Bellapais and Catalkoy.</p>
        
        <h3>Property Purchase</h3>
        <p>Foreigners can purchase property in Northern Cyprus, though the legal process requires careful navigation due to the political situation.</p>
        
        <h2>Healthcare</h2>
